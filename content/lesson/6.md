### What is LLVM?

- [LLVM][] is a very popular compiler infrastructure for C and other languages, including Rust.
- It has a nice SSA-form IR and a nice API for manipulating it.
- In one sense, it is like a supercharged version of Bril. (Not coincidental because I modeled Bril after it.)
- It is also, in a sense, the *opposite* of Bril because it is *real* infrastructure that the world *really* runs on for *lots* of software out there. It’s likely that some of the software you’re using, somewhere along the chain, to watch this video was compiled with LLVM.
- So it is 10,000 times more realistic. Which is great, but it means that some ways Bril is “idealized” will be ruthlessly not-idealized in LLVM.
- Did I mention that LLVM is written in C++? So we’re going to write in C++ (a sharp contrast from Bril, where any language will do).

### Getting Started

- We will follow an old [tutorial][blog] I wrote.
- You will need to install LLVM. (And also [CMake][].)
	- Not covered in detail here. It’s probably in your package manager. There are also tips in [that blog post][blog].
	- For example, try `brew install cmake llvm` using [Homebrew][brew] on macOS. (On macOS, please install from Homebrew instead of using the version that comes with Xcode.)
	- Make sure you can do `clang --version`.
- Compile C programs to LLVM IR: `clang -emit-llvm -S -o - something.c`
- Show off the [language reference][langref]. (RTFM often!)
- Show off the Doxygen pages (and how to Google for them).

### Writing a Pass

Please follow the [“LLVM for Grad Students”][blog] tutorial.

## Tasks

- Follow the LLVM tutorial blog post far enough to implement a pass that changes program execution.
    - This is intentionally open-ended. You can be as ambitious or as unambitious as you want.
    - An example of an unambitious but acceptable task would be to print out a message every time the program uses floating-point division.
    - An example of an ambitious task would be to implement a fancy optimization on LLVM IR and make sure it speeds things up in actual wall-clock time execution.
- Find a real-ish C/C++ program somewhere and run your pass on it to observe the results.
