## Gist

* Welcome to CS 6120! I'm really excited for the semester.
* What is a compiler, and why should we care?
    * A simplistic answer is all about making programs go fast. And optimization is important, but compare Moore's law to Proebsting's law.
    * This class is about *language implementation* more broadly. What else goes into a good language implementation other than optimizations? (Not parsing.) Post your ideas in the [discussion topic][topic].
    * New languages + new hardware = lots of interesting problems.
* Course overview and the [syllabus][].
    * 6120 is kind of an experimental course anyway, and this semester it's going to be even weirder.
    * We're trying a mostly-[flipped][] model where the synchronous portion is primarily about quietly hacking and asking questions, and the primary content delivery mechanism consists of lessons like the one you're looking at now.
    * Communication will be on [Zulip][]. [Sign up][zulip-signup] and stay on top of it!
    * Lessons, tasks, and projects.
    * Hacking sessions.
    * This website and the [blog][], including the [GitHub repository][gh] where you'll send PRs. Work for 6120 is "real," open source, and for the world.
    * "Michelin star" grading.
    * Policies, academic integrity, respect, accessibility.
* Debugging the course structure.
    * Ask questions about the course setup in this lesson's [discussion topic][topic]!
    * Your first task is below: introduce yourself in the [introductions topic][intro] right now.
    * When you've done that, submit the L1 marker assignment on [CMS][].

## Tasks

* Read the [syllabus][]! Seriously, please [actually read it][s].
* [Sign up for Zulip][zulip-signup] and introduce yourself in [the introductions topic][intro].
* Pick a paper from the [schedule][] whose discussion you want to lead.
  Claim it by opening a pull request that modifies [`content.toml`][cont-gh] to fill in your name on one of the `leader = "TK"` lines.
  (Feel free to ask questions about the papers on Zulip to help you decide!)
* Submit any text file you like to the L1 [CMS][] assignment to indicate that you've done the introduction and claimed a paper.
